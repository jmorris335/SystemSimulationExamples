These are the files for simulations in MATLAB, representing imperative, non-functional models.

Contents
- DrivenPendulum_Case1.m : simple imperative simulation of Case 1 for the driven pendulum
- DrivenPendulum_Case2.m : holistic imperative simulation of Case 2 for the driven pendulum
- Pendulum.m : class template for a simple pendulum (showing object-oriented programming in MATLAB)
- animateDoublePendulum.m : helper function for animating the driven pendulum
